VL—-PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE.
(α) Μ. ΡοΒοΙυε CATO.

lMarous Porcius Cato was born at the
Latin town of Tusculum, 234 Ro. His family,
though plebeian, was ancient and. honourable.
Many of his ancestors, true types of the old
Roman peasantry, were noted as hardy warriors
and sturdy farmers. His boyhood was spent
on the Sabine farm belonging to his father,
where hard work and frugal fare strengthened
his naturally robust frame to such a degree that
even in his old age he never exhibited signs of
²weakness or fatigue. After receiving the best
education that could be obtained at the school
of his native place, he enlisted as a common
soldier in the year memorable for the disastrous
defeat of the Romans at Lake Trasimenus.
Under his ideal commander‚ ³Q. Fabius Maximus,
he fought at Capua, and at Tarentum, and under
Claudius Nero, at the decisive battle of the
Metaurus, where his bravery greatly contributed
to gain the victory for the Romans. After
serving the ordinary number of years as a sol·
dier, Cato returned home to till his farm. ⁴N ear
it was the humble cottage of Curius Dentatus,
who had gained many a hard fought battle over
the Sabines and Samnites, and over Pyrrhus.

lsurnamed Censorinus, from his memorable eensorship; Priscus, and
Major, to distinguish him from Cato Uticensis.
