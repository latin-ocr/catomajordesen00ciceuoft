'wc—senes : ‘⁶ are also called (by the title) elders, as they
really are. '' The Spartan Senate (γερουσία) was an
aristocratic assembly composed of twenty-eight mem-
bers with the two kings as presidents. No one was
eligible for this assembly unless he was 60 years osage‚
of unbleinished character and of good soeial standing.
In Cicero's time the first civil office that gave admission
to the senate was the quaestorship, which by the lex
annalis could be earliest held at the age of 31, but in

former times the age required may have been much
greater.
