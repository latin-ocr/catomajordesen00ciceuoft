NOTEs - CHAP. 111. [§ 6-15 7.

neuter gerundive‚ if the verb is transitive, is used in
early and unclassical writers as Plautus, Lucretius and
Varro, and in the poets who affected an archaic style,
as Silius Italicus. The only passages in Cicero are the:
present one and Fragm. p. Scaur. 13: obliviscendum
nobis putatis matrum ἱη liberos, virorum in *uxorea
εσρῖωα. Itis probable that Cicero imitated the Greek
construction of verbals ἰη-τὲος, as we may say
Ταῖί 'a ημῖν ’ΤΟΛηΤὲίΖ ἑσΤΙΡ) ΟΥ TUI-(L ημῖν ΤΟίηΤ ιὲΟῙ) ἐστίν.
