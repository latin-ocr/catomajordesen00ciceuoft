referred tois found in the l'haezlo of Plato (ξ 24—§ 34)
and may be stated thus ε Nothing can he dissolved or
dissipated, unless it is compounded, for ‹lissolution
is a return into original elements. Now the soul is
simple, uncompounded, not cognizable by the senses,
and, therefore, incapable of ‹lis-solution, but endued
with properties of existence independent of the body.

mmmmm—recordari: “and it is a strong argument

that men know very many things in a previous state of
existence (literally, before they are born), because,
even though boys, when they are learning difficult
subjects, so quickly do they comprehend an endless
variety of things, that they do not seem then for the
first time to be acquiring them, but to be recalling them
to memory and to be dwelling on the recollection of
them.’' We have here a reference to Plato’s doctrine
of pre-natal ideas. Plato distinguishesuvtssn‘s, ‘memory,'
the conservative faculty, the preserver of sensation, from
ἀνάμνησις, ‘recollection,' the reproductive faculty, “the
recollection of those things which the soul saw (in
eternity), when journeying in the train of the deity.”
(Phaedrus ἓ 62). All knowledge (Phaedo ξ 17—-§ 22)
is the recollection of truth unfolded to us in a former
state of being, sor there is nothing real but the idea, to
which we cannot attain in this life. From this Plato
deduces the doctrine of Immortality. NVordsworth has Δ
referred to the same doctrine in his Ode on Intimations
os gglmonamy from Revelacions of Early c'liildkood.

Our birth is but a sleep and a rorgetting;
The sou! that rises with usa, 0111· life's star,
Rath had elsewhere its setting,

And vometh rrum asam

Not in entire sorgetsulness

And not in uttvr nakedness,

But trailing clouds οἵ elon-y do we come
From God, who is our Home.

”huc—fere, sc. arqumenta sunt : “these represent for the

most part the arguments of Plato.”
