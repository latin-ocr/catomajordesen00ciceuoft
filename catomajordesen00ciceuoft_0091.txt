CHAPTER 1.—§ 1.

ἐ l.-—¹O Tite. Cicero, in dedicating this dialogue to his friend
Titus Pomponius Atticus, quotes some hexameter
verses, which in the Annales of Ennius are addressed
to Titus Quinctius Flamininus, the conqueror os
Macedonia. For forty days Flamininus had been
vainly endeavouring to find a path across the Pindus
range to attack Philip, the King of Macedon, when he
met a shepherd who offered to be his guide. The
victory of Cynoscephalae followed, 197 Β. C. These
verses are spoken by the shepherd to Flamininus.

²qut'd: accusative, defining the extent or compass of the
ffitigzgfghe verb. H. 371, 1, 3) (2); A. δι G. 240, a ;
. , .

'adjfiero—-adjzzvera In the perfect and derived tenses
the letter v between two vowels is often suppressed
and (unless when a or e followsi or ιι) the second
vowel is merged into the first, as avvzcrvi-ssezattzccsse,
but aucliveram=aadieram. The shortening of u
arises from the tendency to shorten a vowel before
another vowel.

‘levassozlevavera Peile (Greek and Latin Etym. p. 296)
explains this form as originally levam-so, then levavero α
or lez-aro. The second 3 in levasso is superfluous and
compensates for the loss of v and i. For the sinking
of 8 to r: cp. asa, quaeso, arbos, for the later forms
ara, quaero, arbor. .

“coquic: “frets‚” a metaphorical meaning not common
except in poetry. Cp. Virg. AEn. 7, 3443 Sil. 14, 103.

‘versam “keeps agitating‚'’ a frequentative from verto.
Notice the quantity of the final syllable. The quantity
of the 3rd sing. was not different originally from the
quantity os the 2nd sing. We have amittebfft(Virg.
AEn. 5, 853); arcu (Hor. Od. 3, 12, 26) ; riam (Hor.
Od. 2, 4, 14); videt (Virg. AEn. 1, 308).
