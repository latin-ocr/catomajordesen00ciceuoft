war against Antiochus as ¹Ie9atns on the staff of

the consul Glabrio. He turned the battle of
Thermopylae by performing a difficult and
dangerous march across the spurs of Mt. Oeta,

and attacking the king's forces in the rear.

From this period till his death, his life was a
constant battle against political corruption. To De s? t , ,μ

and pictures, were subjected to a tax thirty

times as high as that levied on ordinary pro-

perty. Still even the sternness of Cato pleased

his countrymen, who saw beneath the narrow-

minded policy honesty of purpose and integrity
