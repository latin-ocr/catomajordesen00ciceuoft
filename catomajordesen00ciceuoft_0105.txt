Spurius Carvilius, his colleague, remained passive, took
a stand as sar as he could against Caius Flaminius, a
tribune os the people, when (the latter) was attempting,
contrary to the expressed wish os the senate, to parti·
tion the Pieenian and Gallie land among individuals.’'
what would have been the meaning had Cicero used re-
dderet? H. 519; A. ἃ G. 320, e.—dt'1'i‹lc⁴nct'. The
preS. part. like the pres indic. sometimes denotes an ac-
tion merely attempted (the ementire present). A. δε G.
276, b. The bill referred to (lex Flaminia) was passed
according to Polybius (2, 21) in 232 B.C., while Cicero
here gives the date as 228 B.C., the year in which
Fabius Maximus and Carvilius were consuls. The
measure was carried in spite of the opposition of the
senate, an act strictly unconstitutional‚ as this was an
administrative bill which sell within the power os the

· Senate. Polybius dates the decline of the Roman con-
stitution from the blow that the influence of the senate
received in consequence os the passing of the bill.

The augurs were originally three in number, then four,
and were finally increased by Sylla to fifteen. They
were at first elected hythe comicia curiata, but aster-
wards had the right of adding to their numbers. They
were the highest authorities on religion, but frequently
abused their power and eventually became mere tools
in the hands of politicians. Cato had no very exalted
ide2 of the Roman ministers os religion. Cp. Cic.

N. D. 1263 Div. 2. 24, where he ridicules the ’

haruspices.

‘quaeserrentur: Η. 531 ; A. ἃ G. 336. Cato probably
means that the augutu-2 :should not abuse their power for
political purposes‚ but that patriotic motives should
override all other considerations. A similar disregard
sor oracles is put into the mouth os Hect01·(}10m.11. 12,
243,); εἶς οἰωνὸς ἀριστος ἁμίίἐπθαι περὶ πάτρης; ‘the
one best omen is, to light sor one’s native land.’
