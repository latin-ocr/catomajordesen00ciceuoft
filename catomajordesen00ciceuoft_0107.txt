’dome-stica, i. e. wars carried on by the Romans ; externa,
those carried on by foreign states. Others take the
meaning to hc. civil wars and those carried on abroad,
asin Caes. Bell. Gall. 5, 9, 4. These wars would be
learned from the annales, written records of the magis-
trateS, giving an account os the principal events that
happened each year. It is very doubtful if the
Romans knew anything of foreign history till their
intercourse with Greece.

”cufim—neminem. .· “his conversation at that time 1
eagerly embraced everyopportunity ofenjoying‚ just (ica)
as though 1 was then foreboding an event which came
to pass, that aster his death Ι should meet with no one,
from whom I should learn (anything).''—ita‚ not taken

battles fought by land and sea, wars carried on by
them, (and) triumphs (they have gained).'’ He refers
here to the Elder Scipio Africanus, who conquered
Hannibal at Zama (202 B. C.) It seems strange for
cato to praise Scipio, to whom he was bitterly opposed·
Notiee, the place os a copula in Latin is osten supplied ¹
by repeating in the beginning of each member of a
sentence a word common to all (anaphora). M. 434,
obs. 2. Distinguish recordor, implying a habitual
dwelling of the memory on the past, from memini, mean-
ing simply to have retained something in the memory,
