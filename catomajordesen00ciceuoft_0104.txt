Uet—molliebat.- “ and by his persistence he tamed down
Hannibal exulting in the manner ofa youth.’' Hanni—
bal was born in 247 B. C. so [hat he would be 29 years
of age when he entered Italy—praeclare, sc, dicit.

¹²czmctanclo: “by loitering‚⁷⁷ an allusion ιο his policy,
which gave him the asstzomen, Cunctator. (See
proper names under Maximus). These lines are taken
from Ennius (Ann. 8, 27). Cp. De Off. 1, 843 Livy,
30, 26; Virg. 6, 8473 Ovid Fasti, 2, 242.—rem=
rem publicam: “ our state.''

Haemum. Both noenum, and noema are old forms os non,
acontraction forne unum. Keys (Lat. Gr. p. 374)
regards ne as the simplest form of the Latin negative,
still retained in nefas, nequit, nemo, neque, &c. It
seems a common thing in languages to modisy the
negative; cp. English not = A. 5. ηρ-ἂ-ωἱήι = ww
-ιῖἷιῐ, “not awhit.’' So we have ne-pas, ne—poz'nt‚

unimores—salutem, se, reipublicae .· “he placed not
fame before (his country's) safety.’·’ Scan this line
noticing any metrical peculiarity. See note 6, ξ 1, on
versat. postque. Another reading is plusque. Plu-s
and maqis both signify more, but the former (like
amplius) relates to quantity, the latter to degree ; the
former corresponds to the comparative of much, the
latter to that of very. M. 305, obs. 2.

here and in De Orat. 2, 67, makes a mistake in saying
that M. Livius Salinator held the citadel of Tarentum,
when Hannibal was in possession of the town. It was
M. Livius Macatus, not Salinator, who had this honor.
Cp. Livy. 25, 9-11 ; 27, 25, where the story is given.

²qzaei-qarcem: “who on the loss of the town had taken
refuge by fleeing into the citadel.” What would the
meaning have been had Cicero said in arce ? Trans-
late in this connection : omnes se in silvas abdiderunt,
and omnes se in silvis abdiderunt. H. 435, 1.; A. ἃ.
G. 153.
