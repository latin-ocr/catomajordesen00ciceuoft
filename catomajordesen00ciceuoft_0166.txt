CHAPTER XXII.

ἓ 79.-¹apn‹l : see note 1, g 30. The whole passage is from the
Cyropaedia of Xenophon, VIII. 7, ξ 17——§ zze—major,
se. ηαειι : “ the elder :'’ cp. Cyrum minorem, ξ 59.

“nolite—fore: “don't imagine, my dearest sons, when I
shall leave you, that I shall exist no where or cease to
exist.”——5silii : his chief sons were Cambyses, who
succeeded him, and S1nerdis.—-nztllmn, here z non, as
also in nullum videbitis below ε see note 2, ἕ 74. The
expression nunquam ant nullum fore is tautological

mam eram. In the sense of ‘ while‚' dnm generally takes
the pres. indic. but the imperf. is used when the time
referred to is emphatically contrasted with some other.
H. 522, I. 3 A. ἃς G. 276, e, note.

*eundem—ridebitis: “believe, therefore, that Ι am the
same even though you will not see me at all.'’—ezmdem
and nullum agrees with me understood, not with ani-

thzcmb—-cgl'erlidoce : for the form, see H. 537, 1.; A. &
. 2 9, .

§80.—¹si—-teneremus : “if the souls of those very ones had no
effect in causing us to keep up a remembrance οί
them longer.’'—qz‹0 : see note 2, ἓ 41.

hailai—emori: “ no man has ever been able to convince
me at least that souls, while they were in mortal bodies,
live, (and) that they die, when once they have left
them.'' For the subjunctive of oratio obliqua, see H.
531 ; A. ἃ G. 336.

³insipientem: “was ‹levoid of the powers of thought.”
He thus translates Xenophon's ἆφρωυ.

⁴sed——sc1p1'entem: “but rather that it then possesses the
powers of thought, when freed from every admixgure
of body it begins to be refined and uncontaminated. ’--
sapientem, hardly expresses φρονιμώτατον of Xenophon.

⁵ceterarum—sunt 3 “ it is evident whither each of the
other things departs‚ for all of them return to that place
whence they had their origin.'' In the Timaeus, Plato
admits two primary and uneorruptible principles, God
and Matter. Matter, in his philosophy, is an eternal,
infinite principle, without form or quality, but capable
of undergoing any form or change, without any loss.
The body and soul return to their elements after death.

mmmm—apparet: “ whereas the soul alone is invisible,
either when present (in the body), or when it leaves it.’'
