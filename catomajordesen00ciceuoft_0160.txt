CHAPTER XX.

ἓ 72.-—¹certu8: “ fixed ;’' as in certus cursus, see note 7, ξ 33.
²vivicur: “one lives ;'' see note 4, §67.

Quoad—possis: “so long as one is able to perform and
maintain the requirements of his station.'' For quoad :
see H. 521, I.; A. ὃς G. 328. For the person of
possis, see note on exerceas, 2, ἓ 21.

43ae quo—sortior ε “ whence it happens that old age is even
more spirited and courageous than youth.’'—-animosus,
refers to the spirit and ardour of the soul ; forti-3, to the
strength and firmness of the mind.

&oc—senectute z ‘⁶ this is the meaning of that answer which
was given by Solon to the tyrant Pisistratus, when, to
the latter asking the question, on what hope, pray,
relying he so boldly withstood him, he is said to have
answered, ‘on old age.⁷ ''-—est ι see note 1, ξ 69. —icci
governed by respondisse. —tandem z in questions indi-
cates astonishment that the person addressed has gone
so far as to do or say what he has—sibi referring to
the same person as illi. M. 49o.——senectute i. e. (se
fretum fuis-se) senectute.

⁶coa97mntacic: “cemented.'' Notice the metaphorae in
coaymentavit, conylucinazvic, conylutinacio.

'‘ita—sit ι “therefore it happens that the brief remainder of
life ought neither to be eagerly coveted by the aged,
nor left without (sufficient) reason.⁷‘—reliquum, either
an adjective used substantively or agreeing with tempus
understood. The Stoics held that a wise man may
reasonably withdraw from life in extreme cases because
life may be less consistent with virtue than death.

Sira-§ussu—decedere: “without the order of our general,
that is, God, to leave our post and station in life.'’ The
same doctrine is given in Plato, Phaedo, ἓ 6, where
Socrates quotes Philolaus, the Pythogarean, ὡς ἐν τινι
φρουρᾷ ἐσμέν οἱ ἂνθρωποι καὶ οὺ δεῖ δὴ ἑαυτὸν ἐκ ταίντης
λίέιν οὐδ’ ἀποδιδράσκειν, ‘that we men are in a kind of
prison, and one ought neither to free himself from it
nor run away.’ So also more clearly, Cic. Somn. Scip.
3 : quare et tibi et piis omnihus retinendae est animus
in custodia corporis, nec injussu ejus, a quo ille est
vobis datus, ecc hominum rica miyrandum est, ne
mun zt-sh ιι man ιι m assignatum a Deo defugyisse videamini.
So also Cic. Tusc. 1, 30.
