INTRODUCTION.

(b) P. CORNELIUS Semo.

¹P. Cornelius Scipio, born 185 Β. O„ was
the son of Aemilius Paulus, the conqueror of
Perseus, but took the name of his adopted
father, Scipio the Elder. Under his father he
served his first campaign at Pydna. Literature
and philosophy, however, were to him more
attractive than military glory. From his youth
he was noted for his strong attachment to the

. Greek people and language, and he became the

leader in the Hellenistic inovement that sprang
up in his day. The historiali Polybius and the
philosopher Panaetius were inmates of his house.
After serving· as military tribune in Spain and
in Africa, he returned to Rome and was chosen
aedile, and afterwards consul for two successive
years. Much against hiswilh he undertook the
war against Karthage‚ and is said to have wept
over the destruction of the once haughty rival
of Rome. His censorship was marked by an un-
successful attempt to reform the state on true
Catoni-an principles. He brought the Spanish
war to a close by taking Numantia. For his
open approval of the death of his kinsman‚
Tiberius Gracchus, he incurred unpopularity,
and took no part in politics till an, attempt was
made to revive the Agrarian bill of Gracchus,
After opposing it vehemently he was escorted
home from the Senate by an enthusiastic crowd
of admirers, whose interests were threatened by
its provisions ; but next morning he was found
dead in bed. Suspicion pointed to Carbo as the

 

¹Surua1ued Aemilianus, from his father's uame; Africanas, from liis
conquest of Karthage, 146 Β. Ο.; Nanmntinus. from taking Numantia, 1:43
13. C.. ali-l Minor, to distin-suisli him from ‚anp‘m Major.
