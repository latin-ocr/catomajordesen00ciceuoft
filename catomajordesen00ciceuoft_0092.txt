36 NOTES—CHAP. 1. [§ 1.

nmquid,- expects here an affirmative answer, as in Cic.
Cat. 1, 8, ecquil attendis, enquid animadvertis horum
silentium. The other compounds of en (or ec before q)
have a negative meaning as enunqaam, ecquando.
Z. 351. Ec or en is simply interjecrional, and has no
connection with ecce, “behold''

&pr-aemi. Another reading is pretii. The genitive of
nouns iii—ium, isi, not ii in Virgil, Horace, Tibullus
and Propertius. Ovid seldom uses ii. The MSS. os
Cicero leave us in doubt as to his usage. Z. 49. For
the gen. see H. 396, ΙΙΙ. 2, 3; A. ἃ G. 216, 3.

‘’illc-fidei: “that man (furnished) with no great wealth,
but full of integrity‚'' referring to the shepherd men—
tioned above. —Itazccl is stronger than non, and is chiefly
used to limit adjectives and adverbs denoting a measure.
In the case of verbs it is seldom used, except in the
phrases, leand scio, haud dubito. Note the litotes in
haud maana. There is little force in cum here, as the
the meaning would be expressed without it. M. 257,
258. Notice the scansion of this line. In the older
Latin poets, final s, in the case of—zzs and—is had a
slight and scarcely perceptible sound, before a word
beginning with a consonant, and was, therefore, disre—
garded in scansion, so that the uv or ἱ remained short.
The quantity offidei is also found in Lucr. 5, 103,

but commonly fidei. So also e is common in rei and
only short in spei.

¹⁰qnamquam z καίτοι, “and yet‚” corrective to a former
statement. M 443.

Heerlo scio .· “ 1 am positive.'' Distinguish certo, a
particle of affirmaffion, “surely‚’' ‘⁴ certainly,'' from
certe, which generally modifies a statement, “at least.''
Certe is, however, often used for certo, especially in the

phrase certe scio, which is more common in Cicero
than certo scio. Z. 266, note 1.

¹²Flamininum, attracted into the case of te. The regular
construction would be, nt Flamininus sollicitatur.
Α. ἃ* G. 336, a. Rem, 3 M. 402, b.

”noctesque diesque. The use os -que -que for et—et is
poetical. Sallust is the only good prose writer who
uses it. Cat. 9: seque remque publicam curabant:
cp. also Jug. 10. The only exception to this is when

—que is appended to a relative, as in quique exissent,
quique ibi mansissent. Z. 338.
