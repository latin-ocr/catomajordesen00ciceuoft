P RE FAC Ε.

In preparing this Edition of the Fato illajor, the Editor
has kept in view the requirements of Students reading
for the High School Intermediate and the University
Pass Matriculation Exaniinations. The greatest care has
been taken to render clear the meaning of the text, both
by translations of difficult passages, and by copious

references to the Latin Grammars of Harkness, and
Allen and Greenough. The Edition of the former

Grammar used in the notes is that of 1871, but for the
benefit of those who have the latest American Edition
(1881), a table will be found at the end of this work in
which are given the corresponding sections of the two
Editions.

In the text, the Editor has adopted, almost without
exception, the orthography sanctioned by recent investi-
gations in Philology, and now generally employed in¹
the best Editions of Latin authors. The following may

be summarized as the chief points in this respect :

(1) The genitive of nouns in, -ἱιιε and, ——z‘um is written,
-ἱ, not —ii.

(2) The diphthongs oe, (ιε, are so written, ηδτ oe, oe.
