Notas—enan IV. [§ 12.

²‹lzcam qzoo modo z (licam, enm modam qno. The clause
is relative, not interrogative, so that tulit is not put for
tulerit. So also Cic. pro Rosc. Amer. 30 τ quaeramus
uhi maleficium est, where urbi refers to an ibi suppressed.
Z. 553. The son referred to had the same name as his
father, and was consul in 213 B. C. (Livy, 24, 44),
Cicero's affectionate mention of the death of the son of

Maximus probably called up sad feelings in his own
case. Cp. ξ 85.

“est—laudatio, se, funebris: “the eulogy pronounced at
the funeral is in (everyone's) hand,s⁷’ i.e. isjvell known.
The funeral oration was generally delivered from the
rostra by some near relative of the deceased. The cus·
tomis said to have beenintroduced by Poplicola in honor
of Brutus (Livy, 2, 47). The oration of Fabius is now
lost, although it was extant in the days of Cicero (Tusc.
3, 70).

4(μιαιη z et eam. He alludes to the Stoics‚ many of
whom wrote treatises on applying the principles of
philosophy to alleviate suffering. Fabius practically
illustrates the consolation which philosophy brings by
a living example. We can hardly help noticing that
the character here drawn of Fabius may well be applied
to Cato himself.

⁵in luce——in oculis: “in public—in his intercourse with‚''
antithetical to intus domique: “in retirement and at
home.

“qni sermo .· “what conversational powers.'’ Notice, the
omission of the verb adds strength. For sermo, see
note 4, ἓ 3.——prctecepta: “ pithy sayings‚’' “ maxims.’'

⁷‹1aanta—auyari: “what an intimate acquaintance with
ancient history, (what) a knowledge of the ecclesias-
tical law.’' The jaas· anyto-ium was a code of rules by
which the college of augurs interpreted the auspices or
expressed the will of the gods. Distinguish jus, what
the law ordains or the obligations it imposes, from
lew, a written statute or ordinanee.

multae—litterae .· “ his learning, too. was great, consider—
ing that he was a Roman.⁷’ The full construction is :
multae litterae (erant in Fabio), ut in homine Romano.
XVhen ut adds an explanation‚it may mean, ‘as you would
expect,' or ‘as you would not expect‚' as here. The Ro-
mans had little literature before the conquest of Greece.
The early period of their history produced nothing
but a few chronicles and rude poetical experiments.
