memini is joined with the present infinitive, although
the action may be completed, the speaker thus trans-
fering himself to the past and describing the action as
if it were in progress before his eyes 3 but when the
sentence is only a statement of result memini is joined
with the perfect infinifive. Z. 589. The second consul-
ship of Mettellus was in 249 B. C. ε he was pontifex
maximus, 243 Β. C. and died 221 B. C. when Cato
was at the age of 13. Since the first consulship of
Metellus was in 251 B.C.‚ we may be safe in concluding
that he was probably 80 years of age when he died.

CHAPTER X.

§31.-¹videtisne :norme videtis. The particle, —ne added to
a verb has sometimes in Cicero the force of nonne.
Cp. Cat. 1, 133 meministine mein senatu dicere. So
frequently in Terence, Platus and colloquial Latin.

'ut ε see note 5, ἓ 26.—apud: see note 1, ἓ 30.

³Nestor-praedice5: as in Hom. 11. 1, 260 3, 11, 667 sqq.
where Nestor ‘ garrulous recounts the deeds of youth.'
Distinguish praedicet, from praedicet.

*tertiam aetatem: cp. Hom, 11. 1, 250. Nestor's age at
the time of the war of Troy was probably about seventy
or eighty, placing an aetas at thirty years. Paley
seems to reckon a generation sorty or fifty years.
Ovid (Metam. 12, 187) erroneously represents Nestor
above two hundred years old.: viai (i.e.‚ Nestor)
annos bis centum, nunc tertia vicitur aetas.
