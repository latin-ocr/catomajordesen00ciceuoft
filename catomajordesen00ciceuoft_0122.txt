66 nores—cnsp, ix. [ξ 27-§ 28.

mmmmm-prudentia, sc, juris: “whose insight (into
law) continued even to their latest breath.⁷' Note
prudentia : providentia, and the euphemism in
ultimum spiritum.

ξ 28.—¹0rator : note the emphatic position not merely because
it is first in the sentence, but because it is out of its own
clause. Preserve the emphasis by translating : “ as
to the orator, Ι am afraid that he may become feeble in
consequence of old age, for the gift of it (ἰ. e. oratory)
depends not merely on talent, but on lungs also and
on strength.”—-ne ι Η. 492, 4; A. & G. 331, f.

2ονηηίηο-ανωιοδ : “ no doubt that melodiousness which the
voice possesses (in voce), gains brilliance, too, in some
way or other, in old age3 and, in fact, I, as yet, have
not lost it, and you see (my) years.''—canorum:
adjectives are often used as abstract nouns, verum,
pulchrum, malum. We have in canorum- splendescit
a catachresis, a noun of hearing] being joined to a verb
of siyht. The sense of sight being the keenest of
all, is often elegantly used in place of others. Cp.
Soph. Oed. Tyr. 186: παιὰν λά,ιιπει; “the war song
shines forth ⁷² : Aesch. Sep. 103 : κτὺττον δέδορκα ; “ Ι
saw a noise.”-nescio quo pacto: literally, “I know
not on what terms.''

³sed—remlssus z “ but still the style of speaking that suits
an old man is one that is unimpassioned and subdued.’'
Another reading is senis. remissus : a metaphor
taken from a bow, literally, ‘⁴ unstrung.” See intentum
animum, ἓ 37.

{facitque-oratio : “and the refined and mild language of
an eloquent old man very frequently gains of itself a
hearing for it.'' There is a reference here to the custom
of the crier's (praeco) calling on the people to give
attention to the speaker. Cato says that old age will
of itself command respect. Cp. Plautus : Poen. prol.
1 1 : Exsurye, praeco, fac populo audientiam. For
sermo and oratio, see note 4, ἓ 3.

⁵qzcod—Laelio: “and though one cannot attain that
(style of oratory) himself, still he might be able to
give instruction to a Scipio and a Laelius.” For the
2nd pers. sing. of subjunctive, see note 2, § 21, on
exerceas. For Scipioni et Laelio, see 3, ἓ 13.

⁶stmlae'is juventutis: “by the zeal of youth.” For the
plural, see H. 130, 2 ; A. & G. 75, c.
